# Sonic incredible ripoff Engine

I like acronyms. It gives perfectly good reason to make up stupid names for my projects.

This is my attempt at recreating some of the Sega Sonic engine mechanics. With some artistic licence when
being too lazy to do it properly.

It doesn't have much comments yet, but hey, maybe I'll add some.

## Requirements

* [Love](http://love2d.org/) (0.7.*), and that's pretty much all it needs

## Running

Just type "love __installdirectory__" and it should do the rest.
